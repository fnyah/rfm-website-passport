            CTL OISE/UT Graduate Course on Public History: CTL5057
          </h1>
          <p class="paragraph-5">
            This graduate level public history course explores the diverse
            stories found in our communities; the history of the places and
            spaces where we live; of people, of land, of buildings, that reflect
            our diverse and varied historical landscape. We explore how
            historical knowledge is transferred when it circulates between
            different social arenas or forms of media. We explore how state and
            local narratives have been interpreted and represented in public
            spaces, how concepts of democratization are framed, and we root out
            the historical truths regarding the production and sharing of public
            knowledge. The course offers opportunities to see communities with a
            new lens; examining how historical knowledge in institutional and
            public space is created, contested, and shared. The course supports
            educators seeking to widen their place-based and digital media
            knowledge but also interested in developing strategies for expanding
            their networks to better bridge the gaps between educational and
            community spaces. Students will explore the theory and practice
            reflected in a variety of sources, including websites, apps,
            exhibits, objects, graphic novels, and through field studies that
            will include architecture, streetscapes, monuments, archives, and
            libraries. Students will also be exploring the wide range of
            professional resources available in public archives, museums, parks,
            historic sites, heritage tourism, digital history, oral history,
            media, and public policy research. Students use the course to
            develop a public history digital project where they reach out to
            practitioners in the field to initiate change.

            IDC4UI: The Study of Archives and Local History
          </h1>
          <p class="paragraph-5">
            The IDC4UI (Ontario curriculum) Archives and Local History course
            was designed to bring local communities and students together in
            cooperative research projects that support student learning on the
            ways in which local history has shape their lives. By linking
            with local historical societies, archives, museums, elders and
            others in the local community, students develop a broader
            comprehension of the essential role that local historical work has
            played in maintaining our past and in determining our future. The
            course work supports students in acquiring a highly developed
            understanding of their school, local community, and the broader
            community in which they live and work. As a result of group and
            independent research projects, students develop a greater knowledge
            of the role of public memory, historical consciousness and
            commemoration and citizenship but more importantly, students develop
            a more in-depth understanding of themselves as Canadians. The course
            allows students to develop a greater insight into the role of public
            memory in the preservation of national narratives, and the
            implications our past will have on future Canadian concerns and
            policies about Canadian identity and unity. The students create an
            archive in their school or community that provides a repository for
            their research work. The independent and group research work in this
            course provide students with advanced research and analysis skills
            that will allow them to pursue post-secondary work with greater
            expertise and give them the confidence to work within and beyond
            their local communities

            <h1 class="heading-14">Herstories Cafe</h1>
            <p class="paragraph-5">
              Women, comprising half the population of Canada at any given time,
              are often absent from public stories. This led me to create a
              women’s history talk series in 2009, HerstoriesCafe
              (https://herstoriescafe.wordpress.com) to provide public space for
              honest examinations of women in the past. The talks showcase
              stories from women who share their personal history or their
              research work with the goal of creating a broader discussion about
              how women have influenced Canadian identity. Talks take place in
              public spaces and each talk approaches a specific theme, including
              the arts, education, and civic activism—focused on women’s
              historical experiences as well as links to today. Teachers
              resources are provided.
